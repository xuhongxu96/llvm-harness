# Build Instructions

There are two options to build the project.

## Option 1: Docker Image

### Step 1. Build the Image

```shell
docker build -t llvm-harness:latest -f Dockerfile --build-arg USER_UID=$(id -u) --build-arg USER_GID=$(id -g) .
```

The image is a multi-stage build: each dependency (LLVM, z3, re2c, alive2, llubi, Python venv) is compiled in its own stage, and the final image copies the sources and built files and installs them. This means editing one installation script (e.g. `install_llvm.sh`) does not require rebuilding the other, independent dependencies, and adding a package to the final stage's `apt` list (in `Dockerfile`) does not require rebuilding any of them.

Note, it may take ~15 minutes to build the image, depending on your machine.

### Step 2. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone <path-to-repo>
cd llvm-harness
```

### Step 3. Start the Container

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/llvm-harness --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined llvm-harness:latest
```

Reminder: If you prefer to using local models for example [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), remember to add `--gpus=all` to the above command for NVIDIA.

### Step 4. Bring Up the Environment

Edit `environments` to fill out all required environment variables and then:

```shell
tmux # We need and only support tmux for now
source ./buildscripts/upenv.sh
```

Note that, each time you open a new terminal that does not inherit the global environments of the terminal executing the above command, you should execute the above command again in your new terminal.

### Step 5. Everything is Done


## Option 2: Build Manually

### Step 1. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone <path-to-repo>
cd llvm-harness
```

### Step 2. Install Dependencies

You need a directory to save all dependencies, say `./dependencies`

```shell
tmux # We need and only support tmux for now
export LLVM_HARNESS_DEPS_DIR=$PWD/dependencies
./buildscripts/install.sh
```

### Step 3. Bring Up the Environment

Edit `environments` to fill out all required environment variables and then:

```shell
source ./buildscripts/upenv.sh
```

Note that, each time you open a new terminal that does not inherit the global environments of the terminal executing the above command, you should execute the above command again in your new terminal.
